### Script Overview

This script automates the installation and configuration of the KDE Plasma desktop environment, alongside SDDM as the login manager, Alacritty as the terminal emulator, and Dolphin as the file manager on Arch Linux systems. It ensures that all necessary packages are installed, services are started, and configurations are applied correctly.

### Sections Explained

#### 1. ASCII Art Banners (Lines 3-12, Lines 13-20, Lines 21-28, Lines 31-38, Lines 41-48, Lines 53-60)

```bash
tput setaf 5
cat <<"EOF"
...
EOF"

tput setaf 5
cat <<"EOF"
...
EOF"

tput setaf 5
cat <<"EOF"
...
EOF"

tput setaf 5
cat <<"EOF"
...
EOF"

tput setaf 5
cat <<"EOF"
...
EOF"

tput setaf 5
cat <<"EOF"
...
EOF"
```

- **Purpose**: Enhances the user interface by displaying ASCII art banners at strategic points throughout the script execution. These banners serve as visual indicators of the script's progress.
- **How it works**: Uses ANSI escape codes (`tput setaf 5`) to change the text color to green, followed by printing the ASCII art through a heredoc (`<<"EOF"`).

#### 2. Installing KDE Plasma Desktop (Lines 21-22)

```bash
sudo pacman -S plasma-desktop --noconfirm --needed
```

- **Purpose**: Installs the KDE Plasma desktop environment.
- **How it works**: Uses `pacman`, the package manager for Arch Linux, to install the `plasma-desktop` package. Flags `--noconfirm` skips confirmation prompts, and `--needed` avoids reinstalling packages already present.

#### 3. Installing SDDM Login Manager (Lines 31-32)

```bash
sudo pacman -S sddm --noconfirm --needed
```

- **Purpose**: Installs the Simple Desktop Display Manager (SDDM), a modern login manager designed for use with KDE Plasma.
- **How it works**: Similar to the KDE Plasma installation, `pacman` is used to install SDDM with flags to skip confirmations and avoid unnecessary reinstallation.

#### 4. Installing Alacritty Terminal Emulator (Lines 41-42)

```bash
sudo pacman -S alacritty --noconfirm --needed
```

- **Purpose**: Installs Alacritty, a GPU-accelerated terminal emulator known for its speed and simplicity.
- **How it works**: Utilizes `pacman` to install Alacritty, with flags to bypass confirmation prompts and prevent reinstallation of already installed packages.

#### 5. Installing Dolphin File Manager (Lines 53-52)

```bash
sudo pacman -S dolphin dolphin-plugins --noconfirm --needed
```

- **Purpose**: Installs Dolphin, the default file manager for KDE Plasma, along with its plugins for enhanced functionality.
- **How it works**: Executes `pacman` to install Dolphin and its plugins, with flags to manage confirmation prompts and package reinstallation efficiently.

#### 6. Enabling and Starting SDDM Service (Lines 61-62)

```bash
sudo systemctl enable sddm
sudo systemctl start sddm
```

- **Purpose**: Ensures that the SDDM service is enabled to start automatically at boot and starts the service immediately.
- **How it works**: Utilizes `systemctl` commands to manage the service state, enabling it to run at startup and starting it right away.
